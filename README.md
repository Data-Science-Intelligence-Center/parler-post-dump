# parler-post-dump
A python script and associated xlsx file generated from using the excellent YouTube video ["How to Data Mine the Parler Dump"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZEszws8A45Y) by [Sina Booeshaghi](https://github.com/sbooeshaghi)

Download and extract the g-zipped tar file from https://parlertrick.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/data_no_video.tar.gz (~9GB)

Please note that it took approximately 53 minutes for the complete parsing of the post directory (~335K posts) on an AMD 3600, 32 GB RAM, and a 2TB Samsung EVO SSD in a Debian WSL instance. Your mileage may vary.
